# Machine Learning analysis 
(Some good insights if you look closely, however before anything else your own opinion would prevail dear friends) of user comments to the posts on official Facebook pages (latest 10) of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and Indian National Congress. This period covers aftermath of Phulwana attack and Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman IAF episode. 
In this post we focused mostly on people engagement on BJP's page and compared it with that of Congress's. Kindly notice "Abhinandan, Congratulations and Modi" falls near the middle line, meaning on both the pages people used these words in approximately same proportion ( Figure 1). In the BJP camp (above the line) people mostly used words like "Amit, Ram, Article, Dhara" while the INC witnessed their supporters engaging with words like "Chokidar, Anil, Chor". Further, we made provisions for 6 kind of emotions (anger, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise) in our R code to gauge overall emotional flow on the BJP page and "ANGER" dominated. "Ku$$e" appears to be favourite word for both Modi supporters and bashers alike. A back of the envelope sentiment analysis shows mostly positive polarity on BJP page (Figure 2) and finally, in Figure 3, we make a network of bi-grams (2 word phrases). One interesting node on the network graph is node-point 370 (upper left corner) where people are talking about removal of ("article" or "dhara") 370, or 35A "hatao".

Dear friends, we will keep coming up with better and unbiased outlooks on both the BJP and the Congress by employing latest data science techniques (again we appeal for a helping hand or twoüôè) as election season heats up but above all your views matter the most. Let's know what we could do better.

caveat: we simply removed around 9000 comments that appeared with Devnagri script. We got to tweak our code from plain vanilla text mining to a bit sophisticated programme to cater Hinglish comments with other-than-Roman scripts.

Total # of paragraphs of user comments :: Congress (31759), BJP (39986).


Thnax a lot & kindly üôèstay tuned dear friends üôÇ.
